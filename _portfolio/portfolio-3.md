An AI-powered voice assistant designed to support aging adults in maintaining independence through memory augmentation. The system creates personalized memory assistance using a novel approach that combines CLIP embeddings for localization and ChromaDB for efficient storage, requiring only a brief 2-minute calibration video. This innovative sparse representation technique overcomes traditional limitations of storage constraints and lengthy calibration times in memory assistance systems.
