RoboTutor is an intelligent tutoring system from Carnegie Mellon University that enables offline learning in areas with limited network access. Selected as a $1M Global Learning XPRIZE finalist, the project focuses on teaching basic literacy and numeracy skills through Android tablets.

### Core Innovation
* Fully offline functionality on Android tablets
* Local storage of student progress and learning data
* Adaptive algorithms operating without cloud connectivity
* Sync capabilities when network becomes available

### Technical Implementation
My work focused on the implementation of Multi-armed bandit on the device-side for limited access conditions:
* Built personalized hybrid local-global learning model
* Implemented offline data storage and analytics
* Developed Multi Armed Bandit algorithm using stored weights from previous sessions
* Created sync protocols for intermittent connectivity

### Impact
The system demonstrates effective learning technology deployment in network-constrained environments. Its offline-first design ensures consistent education delivery regardless of connectivity, while maintaining the benefits of AI-driven personalization. The Multi Armed Bandit algorithm personalises learning experience for students by adapting difficulty, speed and repititions based on individual performance.
